### Plot Summary:

Five months into Thaddeus Ross's presidency, Sam Wilson and his partner, Joaquin Torres—the new Falcon—are dispatched to Oaxaca, Mexico. Their mission is to thwart the illegal sale of classified materials stolen by the Serpent Society, a rogue special-ops team led by Sidewinder. While they successfully recover the items, Sidewinder manages to escape. Concerned about the dangers they face, Sam contemplates the involvement of non-superpowered individuals like himself and Torres in such high-stakes missions. To bolster their capabilities, they seek training from Isaiah Bradley, a super soldier who endured imprisonment and experimentation by the U.S. government.

President Ross invites Sam, Torres, and Bradley to a summit at the White House, aiming to discuss the discovery of a new metal, adamantium, found on "Celestial Island"—the remnants of the Celestial Tiamut in the Indian Ocean. Ross proposes a treaty to regulate the mining and distribution of adamantium to prevent a global arms race. During the summit, the song "Mr. Blue" plays, triggering several attendees, including Bradley, to attempt an attack on Ross. The assailants, once subdued, have no recollection of their actions.

Investigations reveal that Dr. Samuel Sterns, who gained advanced intelligence after exposure to Bruce Banner's blood, orchestrated the attack using mind-control technology activated by "Mr. Blue." Sterns harbors resentment towards Ross for broken promises and seeks revenge by tarnishing his reputation. As tensions escalate, Sterns manipulates American pilots to attack a Japanese fleet near Celestial Island, aiming to incite international conflict over adamantium resources. Sam and Torres intervene, preventing the escalation but resulting in Torres sustaining severe injuries.

Confronted with his deteriorating health due to heart failure, Ross admits to relying on pills developed by Sterns to prolong his life. However, these pills have been infusing his body with gamma radiation, leading to uncontrollable transformations into the Red Hulk during moments of stress. In a climactic battle at the White House, Sam confronts the Red Hulk, ultimately calming Ross by reminding him of cherished memories with his estranged daughter, Betty. Ross reverts to his human form and voluntarily incarcerates himself at the Raft, a high-security prison for superpowered individuals.

In the aftermath, Isaiah Bradley is exonerated, the international community ratifies the adamantium treaty, and Sam invites the recovering Torres to join the reformed Avengers. In a post-credits scene, Sterns, now imprisoned, warns Sam of an impending multiversal threat, setting the stage for future MCU storylines.

### Themes and Reception:

The film delves into themes of legacy, responsibility, and the personal costs of power. Harrison Ford's portrayal of President Ross adds depth to the narrative, exploring a leader's struggle with past decisions and their far-reaching consequences.
